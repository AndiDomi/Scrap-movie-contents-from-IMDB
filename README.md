# imdb_database_to_json
With this small java project you can scrap imdb movies to a json file with a caveat ...

Because im too lazy to modify the program you have to manualy open the file with a good text editor and then, 
in the very last line,
replace
,]
with 
]

and thats it

p.s if anyone knows a license free as in "free beer" please tell me the name...
p.p.s dont forget to Star it if you like it :D
